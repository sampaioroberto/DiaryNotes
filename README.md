# DiaryNotes
A project that I created to be a basis for futures studies

# What is this project about?
This project is about diary notes. It was created to be a basis for future studies. We can redesign, add support to Dark Mode, saving data, add some type of architecture, like MVVM or VIPER, and so on. There's a lot to work with!

# What this app can do?
The main screen shows a list with pre-created notes. There's an option to enable edit mode by tapping the right navigation bar button, and to create a new note by tapping the add button at the left in navigation bar. It's possible to edit a single note content by tapping on it.
